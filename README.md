# solarSystemAndSets
this project uses HashSets and Maps in order to organize different celestial bodies into seperate classifications such as planets, stars, moons, etc. Maps are used to map the name of the celestial body to its celestial body object. For instance, "earth" would be the map key and an earth object would be the value for the map as well as an object of the HashSet.
